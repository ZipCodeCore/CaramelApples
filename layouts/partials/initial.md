First, __Thank You__ for taking the time to interview our students. We really appreciate it.

### Do you need help in figuring what questions to ask?

You're busy. Yep, we get it. We'd like to help you figure out what to ask in a mock interview.
Take a look, there a bunch of questions, for both Java and Python, and we'll add more.

### What is here?

Zip Code Wilmington's Mock Interview website is a platform designed to help students and alumni of Zip Code Wilmington, a coding bootcamp in Delaware, USA, prepare for technical interviews. The website provides a simulated interview experience, where users can practice answering technical interview questions and receive feedback on their performance.

The platform offers a variety of interview questions across different programming languages and topics, including algorithms, data structures, and web development. Interviewers can choose the type of interview they want to provide, select the programming language they are most comfortable with, and find questions to ask students in several levels of difficulty.

The Mock Interview website is a valuable resource for Zip Code Wilmington students, and alumni who are helping students to prepare for job interviews in the tech industry. It provides a series of questions and answers that can help them build confidence and improve their technical skills. But they need your help, they need practice. (lots and lots of practice.)

### So, a Little Help...

These questions are just meant to get your mind working on what kinds of questions you could ask during a mock interview. Feel free to modify as you see fit.
Keep the students thinking, that's the only way you can determine if they know what they are talking about.

And if you have any favorites, please send us both the Question and the Answer. It'll get added!
