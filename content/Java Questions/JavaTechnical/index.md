## Test of Titles (h2)

_this is italic_ **this is bold** this is regular.

### In Java (h3)

#### What's a Class? (java)

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the properties and behaviors of objects. The class defines the following:
  instance variables,
  methods,
  constructors,
  nested and inner classes,
  and static fields and methods.

Classes are used in Java, Python, and other object-oriented programming languages. A class is a structure that defines the data and the methods to work on that data. It is a blueprint or a template for creating different objects which defines its properties and behaviors. A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a blueprint for creating objects.

#### What's an Object? (python)

Objects are variables that contain data and functions that can be used to manipulate the data. The object's data can vary in type (string, integer, etc.) depending on how itâ€™s been defined. An object is like a mini-program inside python, with its own set of rules and behaviors.

Objects contain data in the form of attributes (or instance variables) and code in the form of methods.


#### Possible Question Styles (4)

{{% notice style="primary" title="Create a class method `getFoo` that takes a string `f` and returns `f`." icon="question" %}}
But not just code in the answers. There might just be text, eh?
```java
public static String getFoo(String f) {
    return f
}
```
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice style="secondary" title="Declare a variable `x` as a floating point number. Initialize it to `3.14`" icon="question" %}}
They can anser in one or two lines.
```java
double x = 3.14; // declare and init
```
or 
```java
double x; // declare
x = 3.14; // init
```
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice style="secondary" title="Write a for-loop from 0 to 9, printing the index and 'ZipCode'." icon="question" %}}
A very simple __Python__ `for` loop.
```py
for x in range(10)
    print(x, "ZipCode")
```
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice style="warning" title="What's the difference between an abstract class and an interface? When would you use one over the other?" icon="question" %}}
Always use `interface`, as `abstract` classes are hard to cook and even more difficult to eat.
```java
public interface Foo {
    Integer randomDice();
}
```
{{% /notice %}}


Hey, cool, we can do class diagrams if we must.

```mermaid

    Animal : +int age
    Animal : +String gender
    Animal: +isMammal()

    class Duck{
      +String beakColor

      +quack()
    }
    class Fish{
      -int sizeInFeet
      -canEat()

    class Zebra{
      +bool is_wild
      +run()
    }
