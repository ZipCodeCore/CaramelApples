There are many unusual interview questions that can be asked of coders. Here are a few examples:

####  If you could be any programming language, which one would you be and why?
####  If you were stranded on a desert island with only one programming book, which one would you want it to be?
####  If you could eliminate one programming language from existence, which one would it be and why?
####  If you could have any superpower related to coding, what would it be and why?
####  If you could only use one programming language for the rest of your life, which one would it be and why?
